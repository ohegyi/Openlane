Define width + height of die:
Begin with netlist
Add up widths + heights of all standard cells (wires later) (area of this = min area)
Utilization factor - area used by netlist/total core area
Aspect ratio = height/width
Define Locations of Preplaced cells
Combinational logic does some function
Separate into blocks to implement separately (modulation advantage of reuse - like functions)
Blackbox (only see IO)
Put before routing, not touched (implement once, use many times)
Place manually based on specs
Physical Spacing
Physical drop = resistance, so other parts of circuit won’t reach power rail
Noise margin summery = range to still be considered logic 1 ( this is problem with too much distance from power supply, solved by decoupling capacitors)

Power Cell placement
Load receives same signal as driver
Ground bounce due to inverter causing all capacitors to discharge, not ‘0’, danger of undefined zone

Can also get ground droop when all try to get energy from one line
Solve by more power supplies, distributes strain
 V (more power supply lines = less strain, less ground fluctuation)
Pin placement
Interclock timing - units driven by separate clocks
Verilog defines netlist (connectivity formation between gates)
Front end defines netlist, backend decides pin placement
Pick most essential connections - i.e. clocks bc flip flops - to go closest to pins
